## Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

This page contains a web-friendly version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Binding Operational Directive 22-01 - Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.

*A binding operational directive is a [compulsory direction](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3552%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3552)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to federal, executive branch, departments and agencies for purposes of safeguarding federal information and information systems.*

*[Section 3553(b)(2) of title 44, U.S. Code](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title44-section3553&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjQ0IHNlY3Rpb246MzU1MiBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSkgT1IgKGdyYW51bGVpZDpVU0MtcHJlbGltLXRpdGxlNDQtc2VjdGlvbjM1NTIp%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim), authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and oversee the implementation of binding operational directives.*

*Federal agencies are [required](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3554%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3554)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to comply with DHS-developed directives.*

*These directives [do not apply](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3553%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3553)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to statutorily defined "national security systems" nor to certain systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community.*

### Background
The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy. The federal government must improve its efforts to protect against these campaigns by ensuring the security of information technology assets across the federal enterprise. Vulnerabilities that have previously been used to exploit public and private organizations are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types. These vulnerabilities pose significant risk to agencies and the federal enterprise. It is essential to aggressively remediate known exploited vulnerabilities to protect federal information systems and reduce cyber incidents. 

This directive establishes a CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog. CISA will determine vulnerabilities warranting inclusion in the catalog based on reliable evidence that the exploit is being actively used to exploit public or private organizations by a threat actor. This directive enhances but does not replace BOD 19-02, which addresses remediation requirements for critical and high vulnerabilities on internet-facing federal information systems identified through CISA’s vulnerability scanning service. 

### Scope
This directive applies to all software and hardware found on federal information systems managed on agency premises or hosted by third parties on an agency’s behalf. These required actions apply to any federal information system, including an information system used or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency, that collects, processes, stores, transmits, disseminates, or otherwise maintains agency information.

### Required Actions
1.  Within 60 days of issuance, agencies shall review and update agency internal vulnerability management procedures in accordance with this Directive. If requested by CISA, agencies will provide a copy of these policies and procedures. At a minimum, agency policies must:
    
    a.  Establish a process for ongoing remediation of vulnerabilities that CISA identifies, through inclusion in the CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities, as carrying significant risk to the federal enterprise within a timeframe set by CISA pursuant to this directive;
    
    b. Assign roles and responsibilities for executing agency actions as required by this directive;
    
    c. Define necessary actions required to enable prompt response to actions required by this directive;
    
    d. Establish internal validation and enforcement procedures to ensure adherence with this Directive; and
    
    e. Set internal tracking and reporting requirements to evaluate adherence with this Directive and provide reporting to CISA, as needed.

2.	Remediate each vulnerability according to the timelines set forth in the CISA-managed vulnerability catalog. The catalog will list exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise with the requirement to remediate within 6 months for vulnerabilities with a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID assigned prior to 2021 and within two weeks for all other vulnerabilities. These default timelines may be adjusted in the case of grave risk to the Federal Enterprise.

3.	Report on the status of vulnerabilities listed in the repository. In line with requirements for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Federal Dashboard deployment and OMB annual FISMA memorandum requirements, agencies are expected to automate data exchange and report their respective Directive implementation status through the CDM Federal Dashboard. Initially agencies may submit quarterly reports through CyberScope submissions or report through the CDM Federal Dashboard. Starting on October 1, 2022, agencies that have not migrated reporting to the CDM Federal Dashboard will be required to update their status through CyberScope bi-weekly.

### CISA Actions
1.	Maintain the catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities at [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) and alert agencies of updates for awareness and action. 
2.	CISA will publish the thresholds and conditions for including and adding vulnerabilities to the catalog at [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities).
3.	As necessary following the issuance of this Directive, CISA will review this Directive to account for changes in the general cybersecurity landscape and consider issuing Supplemental Direction to incorporate additional vulnerability management best practices for federal information systems. 
4.	Annually, by the end of each fiscal year, provide a status report to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the National Cyber Director identifying cross-agency status and outstanding issues in implementation of this Directive.

#### This seems to indicate that federal agencies are not properly reducing significant risk vulnerabilities. How extensive is the issue?

-  The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy. The Federal Government, along with every organization, must improve its efforts to protect against these campaigns by ensuring the security of information technology assets across the federal enterprise. 
-  This directive will drive more rapid identification and remediation of vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited and therefore pose the highest likelihood of enabling an intrusion. By updating and maintaining the inventory of vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited and requiring regular reporting from agencies on their mitigation progress, CISA will be better positioned to determine the extent and breadth of existing vulnerabilities – and drive remediation thereof. 

#### This is a comprehensive catalog of vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. Will that information be shared in some manner with the public and private sector?

-  CISA will maintain the inventory of vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise at https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities and alert agencies and its partners of updates for awareness and action, including all mitigation timelines. 
-  Any individual will be able to sign up for automatic alerts via email, text, or an RSS feed for changes in the catalog.
-  We strongly encourage every organization to sign up for updates to the CISA catalog and prioritize mitigation 

#### What’s the difference between a High or Critical Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and a known exploited vulnerability?

-  CVEs are currently scored under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which does not take into account whether a vulnerability has ever been used to exploit a system in the wild. 
-  Many CVEs with high and critical CVSS scores are very complex, may require special conditions or permissions, and have only been demonstrated in labs. 
-  In 2020, the cybersecurity community identified more than 10,000 vulnerabilities with either a High or Critical CVSS score, which equates to 28 vulnerabilities per day; however, less than 4-percent of these have been identified as actively used to compromise victims. 
-  Known exploited vulnerabilities are a subset of CVEs which have been used to compromise systems in the real world. Known exploited vulnerabilities are real threats that are being leveraged against systems right now. 

#### Should my organization still use CVSS for vulnerability management prioritization?

-  Today, vulnerabilities are generally “scored” using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). While CVSS remains valuable and should remain a part of most vulnerability management programs, using this approach alone does not always accurately depict the danger of that vulnerability to an affected organization. 
-  Instead of only focusing on vulnerabilities that carry a CVSS score above a certain threshold, we are focused on driving prioritized remediation of vulnerabilities that have known exploits and are being actively exploited in the wild.  
-  This change is driven by our knowledge that attackers do not rely only on vulnerabilities with a “Critical” CVSS rating; in fact, some of the most widespread and devastating attacks have exploited vulnerabilities rated “high”, “medium”, or even “low.”
-  Once an organization has remediated all vulnerabilities on CISA’s catalog that exist in their technology environment, CVSS scores remain an appropriate method to prioritize any remaining vulnerabilities. 

#### What is CISA’s assessment of the way critical infrastructure manages significant risk vulnerabilities?

-  Organizations in the private sector and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government alike struggle to find time to test and implement remediations across complex infrastructures. They don’t have a good way to prioritize the work, because it takes quite a bit of effort – and subject matter expertise – to understand the concrete risk posed by a specific vulnerability, and many organizations may lack the information to do so. 
-  CISA’s catalog of vulnerabilities known to be exploited by adversaries will help organizations fix those vulnerabilities most likely to result in an intrusion. Our catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities will be regularly updated and, most importantly, available to the public. 

#### Why is CISA recommending up to 6 months to remediate these vulnerabilities?

-  While an earlier BOD issued in 2019 established requirements for agencies to remediate vulnerabilities with CVSS scores of critical or high on internet-facing assets, this is the first time that CISA has imposed government-wide requirements to remediate vulnerabilities affecting both internet-facing and non-internet facing assets.  
-  In addition, the six-month timeframe to remediate vulnerabilities identified before 2021 is based upon a likely significant backlog of these vulnerabilities across the FCEB, which will require potentially significant time and effort to resolve.
-  Vulnerabilities included in CISA’s catalog that are identified in 2021 and thereafter must be remediated in a much faster two-week timeframe.
-  These default timelines may be adjusted if a vulnerability poses a particularly grave risk to the Federal Enterprise.
