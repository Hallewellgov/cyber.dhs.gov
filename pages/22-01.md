## Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

This page contains a web-friendly version of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Binding Operational Directive 22-01 - Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.

*A binding operational directive is a [compulsory direction](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3552%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3552)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to federal, executive branch, departments and agencies for purposes of safeguarding federal information and information systems.*

*[Section 3553(b)(2) of title 44, U.S. Code](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title44-section3553&f=treesort&num=0&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjQ0IHNlY3Rpb246MzU1MiBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSkgT1IgKGdyYW51bGVpZDpVU0MtcHJlbGltLXRpdGxlNDQtc2VjdGlvbjM1NTIp%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim), authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop and oversee the implementation of binding operational directives.*

*Federal agencies are [required](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3554%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3554)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to comply with DHS-developed directives.*

*These directives [do not apply](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:44%20section:3553%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3553)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true) to statutorily defined "national security systems" nor to certain systems operated by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community.*

### Background
The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy. The federal government must improve its efforts to protect against these campaigns by ensuring the security of information technology assets across the federal enterprise. Vulnerabilities that have previously been used to exploit public and private organizations are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types. These vulnerabilities pose significant risk to agencies and the federal enterprise. It is essential to aggressively remediate known exploited vulnerabilities to protect federal information systems and reduce cyber incidents. 

This directive establishes a CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities) and establishes requirements for agencies to remediate any such vulnerabilities included in the catalog. CISA will determine vulnerabilities warranting inclusion in the catalog based on reliable evidence that the exploit is being actively used to exploit public or private organizations by a threat actor. This directive enhances but does not replace BOD 19-02, which addresses remediation requirements for critical and high vulnerabilities on internet-facing federal information systems identified through CISA’s vulnerability scanning service. 

### Scope
This directive applies to all software and hardware found on federal information systems managed on agency premises or hosted by third parties on an agency’s behalf. These required actions apply to any federal information system, including an information system used or operated by another entity on behalf of an agency, that collects, processes, stores, transmits, disseminates, or otherwise maintains agency information.

### Required Actions
1.  Within 60 days of issuance, agencies shall review and update agency internal vulnerability management procedures in accordance with this Directive. If requested by CISA, agencies will provide a copy of these policies and procedures. At a minimum, agency policies must:
    
    a.  Establish a process for ongoing remediation of vulnerabilities that CISA identifies, through inclusion in the CISA-managed catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities, as carrying significant risk to the federal enterprise within a timeframe set by CISA pursuant to this directive;
    
    b. Assign roles and responsibilities for executing agency actions as required by this directive;
    
    c. Define necessary actions required to enable prompt response to actions required by this directive;
    
    d. Establish internal validation and enforcement procedures to ensure adherence with this Directive; and
    
    e. Set internal tracking and reporting requirements to evaluate adherence with this Directive and provide reporting to CISA, as needed.

2.	Remediate each vulnerability according to the timelines set forth in the CISA-managed vulnerability catalog. The catalog will list exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise with the requirement to remediate within 6 months for vulnerabilities with a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID assigned prior to 2021 and within two weeks for all other vulnerabilities. These default timelines may be adjusted in the case of grave risk to the Federal Enterprise.

3.	Report on the status of vulnerabilities listed in the repository. In line with requirements for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Federal Dashboard deployment and OMB annual FISMA memorandum requirements, agencies are expected to automate data exchange and report their respective Directive implementation status through the CDM Federal Dashboard. Initially agencies may submit quarterly reports through CyberScope submissions or report through the CDM Federal Dashboard. Starting on October 1, 2022, agencies that have not migrated reporting to the CDM Federal Dashboard will be required to update their status through CyberScope bi-weekly.

### CISA Actions
1.	Maintain the catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities at [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities) and alert agencies of updates for awareness and action. 
2.	CISA will publish the thresholds and conditions for including and adding vulnerabilities to the catalog at [https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities).
3.	As necessary following the issuance of this Directive, CISA will review this Directive to account for changes in the general cybersecurity landscape and consider issuing Supplemental Direction to incorporate additional vulnerability management best practices for federal information systems. 
4.	Annually, by the end of each fiscal year, provide a status report to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the National Cyber Director identifying cross-agency status and outstanding issues in implementation of this Directive.
